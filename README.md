# WikipediaCrawler

Python script from crawling Wikipedia webpages.
This script downloads the webpages in terms of batches and gives you freedom
to work with each batch individually without need to save them to the hard disk.
This avoids unnecessary load on Wikipedia servers and allows you to use the
page content as desired.
